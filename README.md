# GCP-AirFlow-ELT-Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to build an **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** data pipeline to process **1 million records** using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and **Apache Airflow**. The pipeline extracts data from Google Cloud Storage (GCS), loads it into BigQuery, and transforms it to create country-specific tables and views for analysis.

---

## Features

- Extract data from GCS in CSV format.
- Load raw data into a staging table in BigQuery.
- Transform data into country-specific tables and reporting views.
- Use Apache Airflow to orchestrate the pipeline.
- Generate clean and structured datasets for analysis.

### Workflow
1. **Extract**: Check for file existence in GCS.
2. **Load**: Load raw CSV data into a BigQuery staging table.
3. **Transform**:
   - Create country-specific tables in the transform layer.
   - Generate reporting views for each country with filtered insights.

### Data Layers
1. **Staging Layer**: Raw data from the CSV file.
2. **Transform Layer**: Cleaned and transformed tables.
3. **Reporting Layer**: Views optimized for analysis and reporting.
